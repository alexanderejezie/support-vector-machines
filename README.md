# Support Vector Machine Checkpoint

# üéØ What You're Aiming For.
In this checkpoint, we are going to work on the 'Electric Vehicle Data' dataset that was provided by Kaggle as part of the Electric Vehicle Price Prediction competition.

### Dataset description: 
  This dataset contains information on the Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) that are currently registered with the Washington State Department of Licensing (DOL). This dataset was introduced as part of an official invitation-based competition on Kaggle. Our SVM model should answer the question "This is my car's model & make, along with a few other parameters, what price can this vehicle be brought or sold?‚Äù
